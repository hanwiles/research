As far as thought experiments go, I had a lot of trouble deciding where my morality lies when it came to the Witcher 3. 
There's this quest called The Whispering Hillock where you have to decide if you're going to save the children or save a village.

It was hard for me to decide which to do, so I looked up the outcomes of each decision and based my choice on that. Thought experiments
are always interesting for me because you really never know what you'd do until youre in that situation. The immersion involved with
video games can make you feel less emotionally removed from the situation, thus making the actual decision hard to make.
